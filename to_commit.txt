Step 1: Commit and Push the Generated File
To save the generated data1.json file back to your repository, you'll need to include steps in your GitHub Actions workflow to commit and push this file. Here's how to update your workflow to achieve that:

Add a Step to Commit and Push the File:

Update your run-python-script.yml workflow file to include steps that add, commit, and push the generated file.



name: Run Python Script and Update Repo

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  run-script:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.x'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        # Install any dependencies here if needed
        # pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Run Python script
      run: python script.py

    - name: Commit and push changes
      uses: EndBug/add-and-commit@v9
      with:
        author_name: Your Name
        author_email: your-email@example.com
        message: 'Add generated data1.json'
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}


Explanation
EndBug/add-and-commit Action: This GitHub Action automates the process of committing and pushing changes. Itâ€™s convenient for this purpose.
author_name and author_email: Replace these with your name and email.
GITHUB_TOKEN: This token is automatically provided by GitHub Actions to allow workflows to interact with the repository.
Update Your Workflow File: Save and push the updated workflow file.

git add .github/workflows/run-python-script.yml
git commit -m "Update workflow to commit and push generated file"
git push origin main


Step 2: Verify the File in Your Repository
After the updated workflow runs, check your GitHub repository to ensure that data1.json has been committed and pushed.

Navigate to Your Repository on GitHub.
Check the Files: Look for data1.json in the root directory or the location where it was generated.
